# Gravity Book ETL Project 

This project revolves around the development of a database named "Gravity Book." The initial phase involved crafting a comprehensive database model illustrated in a diagram. Subsequently, the focus shifted to designing the data warehouse, where dimensional tables and fact tables were meticulously determined.

Within the data warehouse, two pivotal fact tables were established: "Fact Order" and "Fact Order History" the latter serving as an accumulated fact table. SQL was employed to create these tables, ensuring a robust foundation for the data warehouse.

To facilitate seamless data transfer from the database to the data warehouse, the project incorporated SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). Noteworthy features of SSIS, such as slowly changing dimensions, lookup, and derived columns, were strategically utilized to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of data migration processes.
